## I/O determined ##
I used to consider <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim">AirSim</a> to be the AI's training place, and then I considered to used raspberryPi to build a real world robot to train. These two method, both are hard to realize and have lots of limit. Moreover, it is boring and would take me lots of time. So my work stuck. I was inspired by the game <a href="http://wuxia.qq.com/main.shtml">《天涯明月刀OL》</a>, I found that I can control the character  by some mouse and keybord control software, such as <a href="http://www.anjian.com/download.htm">按键精灵</a>. The world of the Tian Dao is huge and complicated, the scenery is subtle and beautiful, whick could be a good place for a AI to train. So the I/O of this program is determined, I is game scenery, just some screen capture, and may be also some sound the the game or my voice record from microphone; O is keybord and mouse envent, which will control the character in game.
