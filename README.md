## Summerize ##
Intelligent is base on a setted goal. Our goal is to make the most of our life experience like things. Then there are bulk of definitions, that define what kind of things lead to what kind of emotion. like or dislike this emotion was setted, thus our life was setted. 

GeneralAI is a project that tries to make a general AI base on this philosophy. It will present as a vehicle, which comes from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/airsim">Micrsoft open source project *AirSim*</a>. I will add nature language support to make it more intelligent.

This is a long way to go. I gona seperate the final goal into several small part. The first goal is to make this AI knows auto trace object. It means that the AI will be setted to auto trace object. This task seems easy to complete, but I will make it further. 

## Tracing Object ##
Just trace an object is easy, but i need it to auto trace all objects. AI will trace the object base on interest, the interest will be predefined. basicaly, new things, big things, strange thing first. To recognize new thing or *old thing*, it need to record object. *Recording Object* is the core of tracing object, it will help AI recognize and reconstruct world. 

### Recording object ###
recording begin from the start of the running of the program. Recording basic on 3 basic technics  *Grouping, Seperating and continuity recognize*. It will invole 3 nerual networks, I define them to be G for Grouping, S for Seperating, C for continuity recognize.

C net will help to recognize an object from pitures, this object oftenly will be a concept of concept net.

S net will seperate an object recognized by C net into attributes.

G net trying to regroup attribute to reform object. Moreover, it could group object to form a scene. An concept could be a group of object. Maybe I need two networks to realize it?
